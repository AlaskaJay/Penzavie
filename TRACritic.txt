Inspired By:
*Terminator => Android War Machines, makes sense
*Matrix + Tron => Cyberspace, makes sense
*Robocop => Cyborgs, makes sense
*Short Circuit => Android gets sentience but... it's pretty goofy, not the most serious of movies.
*Transformers (any series) => Makes sense
*Gundam (any series) => put a pin in it
*Gurren Lagann => yeah, pin in it
*Casshern => 
*Ghost in the Shell => make sense
*Atomic Robo: Last Stop => yep, makes sense
*Mega Man (any series) => Makes sense
*Armored Core => 
*Zone of the Enders => 
*Metal Gear Rising => robots?
*Ratchet and Clank => Robots, okay
*Portal => What? AIs but... what?

Chapter One: Timeline
Page 13 and 14: There's a lot to unpack here I think...?
Page 15: 
*NONE OF THE STATES WERE SPLIT BETWEEN THE USA AND SSA?
*Also why are you mixing real world political figures into the game? (Kim Jong-Un)
*July 4th is when North Korea nukes South Korea? Really?
Page 17: So the Natural Disasters are what got the American States together? (also The Americas refers to North and South... not USA and SSA)
There's so much grittiness around this setting... like, war and natural disasters and shit...
