TRA Critic

Introduction:
Page 7:
What is a Role-playing Game?: Completely passable
Common Terms: Fine, some goofs were fun
Page 8: 
What Do I Need To Play?: Completely passable, 2 to 5 players sounds fine?
Percentile Dice?: 
*00 + 0 = 0 and you always succeed?
*Doesn't answer at this point if roll == skill is a success.
Using 2d10 instead of Percentile: Passable
What is The Robotic Age?: 
*Anime Inspiration
*"Anything you want to do is possible in The Robotic Age."
*Worldbuilding starts here kinda
*sets up the conflict or whatever, no rules, but like, note this.
Page 9:
Inspired By:
*Terminator => Android War Machines, makes sense
*Matrix + Tron => Cyberspace, makes sense
*Robocop => Cyborgs, makes sense
*Short Circuit => Android gets sentience but... it's pretty goofy, not the most serious of movies.
*Transformers (any series) => Makes sense
*Gundam (any series) => put a pin in it
*Gurren Lagann => yeah, pin in it
*Casshern => 
*Ghost in the Shell => make sense
*Atomic Robo: Last Stop => yep, makes sense
*Mega Man (any series) => Makes sense
*Armored Core => 
*Zone of the Enders => 
*Metal Gear Rising => robots?
*Ratchet and Clank => Robots, okay
*Portal => What? AIs but... what?

Chapter One: Timeline
Page 13 and 14: There's a lot to unpack here I think...?
Page 15: 
*NONE OF THE STATES WERE SPLIT BETWEEN THE USA AND SSA?
*Also why are you mixing real world political figures into the game? (Kim Jong-Un)
*July 4th is when North Korea nukes South Korea? Really?
Page 17: So the Natural Disasters are what got the American States together? (also The Americas refers to North and South... not USA and SSA)
There's so much grittiness around this setting... like, war and natural disasters and shit... Robot Racism in your fun Anime Game?
Page 29, we finally get to character creation.
Element costs 5 CP according to page 30
Abilities: Wall Run makes no sense, do you have to level it past one?

Professionals: have enough to not fail a majority of your skills. 

Let's just run though the fighting styles
At the start of combat, pick a fighting style effect. 

Behemoth: Tankier, but like, 25 damage is two hits?
Berserker: The best one maybe, broken forcefield build, counter attacks are really strong. Why not use the bonus combat action to dash and just be a speedster???
Deceiver: The only example is a human, so you can't see the structure difference. 
Defender: Forcefield slight requirement, but also, the most support combat style
Heavy Hitter: Same broken build as Berserker
Marksman: A damn good DPS
No Style: pacafist run I guess? Not interesting.
Speedster: Why go this when you can just, yknow, be a Beserker? just a different penelty? 

General Skills: where I see plenty of issues.
So general skills start at 0... so you have a 1% chance of passing something you're untrained it, which isn't the most fun.
First Aid... the example contradicts the rule!
Repair, same issue as First Aid
There's a lot of simple or silly skills for a combat focused game with only 21 skills.

UPGRADES:
Registry Blocker: The GM knows their stats from playing, because you're the GM and can just... ask, or you ask them when they roll. 
All Surface Movement: makes Wall Run Ability obsolete
All Surface Contact: uhm, what?
Unlimited Flight doesn't require Limited Flight for some reason.
Energy Scanner: See clocked units? See Invisablity? 
Enhanced Analysis is only a numerical boost
Core Schematics: Wait... Repair can't fix Core? Well, that makes all the easy ways to deal Core damage really scary 
Emergency First Aid Patch: Okay so obviously this is the bacta tanks from Megaman, like so much so, but how much are you going to have a tank that isn't a 5d10? and extended action is so weird. is Difficult a mechanical word? Why would you keep an even 4d10 tank?
Numbers: half off a support unit but it makes upgrading it more expensive.

So now we're at body upgrades.
Elemental Protection: Weird!
