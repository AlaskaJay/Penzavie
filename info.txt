=== Astronomy ===

The solar system in which Penzavie exists is as follows:
> Plumos, the star, a wonderful beacon of light. 
> A rocky and hot planet, dark colors across the surface, blasted by solar winds. Inspitable. The closest to Plumos.
> Penzavie, the second planet, the one where magic happens. It has two moons.
	> Cele: A larger moon, tidally locked, orbits every 26 days
	> Wast: A smaller moon, further out, orbitting once each 53 days. Going there and returning to Penzavie takes from the prime material plane to the Mundane Universe (the universe without magic)
> There are many asteroids between the inner two planets and the outer planets, similar to the solar system containing Earth.
> The Protector is a gas giant that functions similar to Jupiter and protects the inner planets. There is a diety that is associated with this planet. Going to this planet and then back to Penzavie will put someone in the Prime Material, even if they came from the Mundane Universe. Protector has many many moon and rings.
> A small rocky planet that is cobalt and brown.
> A second gas giant that is blue with no rings.
> A third gas giant that is red and has rings. It has a dark band across it's equator. Because of it's tilt, at certain times in history, it looks like an eye, with the rings as the whites, the red as the iris, and the black as the pupel. This affects mythos and there are outsiders that associate with this planet.
> There is a small rocky and ice planet far out. This has three moons. It's cute.
> ALSO THERE ARE MANY BEAUTIFUL COMETS
