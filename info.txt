This txt should have all information you need to understand Penzavie. Remember that this fantasy setting, although DnD compatable, is not purely for Dungeons and Dragons, and is meant to be compatable with other games, such as Dungeon World, Burning Wheel, 13th Age, and others.

=== Cosmology ===
This section is the explanation of what the various planes of existance of the setting are.

> Penzavie, the prime material, the mixture of magic and mundane. 
	This plane is as shown by the map, seen above, and is described in great detail in the section labeled History
> The Mundane Universe, a plain world, not too disimilar to our Earth. No magic at all. 
> The Magic Realm, a world where magic rules. Hard to many people understand the layout of this realm. 
> Iustium, the Upper Ring, the Ring of Law, 
	> Planar North of the prime material
	> Angels, Devils, Modrons, and Inevitables are from this place.
> Conturb, the Lower Ring, the Ring of Chaos, 
	> Planar South of the prime material
	> Archons, Demons, Slaad are from this place.
> The Ring of Elements
	> Circles arounnd the prime material
	> Elementals are from this place.
> The Elsewhere, the space between planes, where Abberations roam.

== About Alignment == 
While the standard DnD alignments are alluded to in this lore, do not think that they are an objective truth. They are a narrative constructed by planar outsiders. While individuals might be able to categorized into an alignment, no race, ancestry, or group can be categorized into an alignment. The standards of what is Good and Evil are subjective. While this fiction instills that bigotry, slavery, and genocide are evil, it is unhelpful to try to use DnD alignment to quantify or categorize groups the way that standard DnD does. 

That being said, Iustium and Conturb as locations have personality and will make assertions on what is lawful and chaotic. Below are examples of how they do so.

Examples of things that are lawful
> Consistancy
> Order
> A river flowing in a jungle
> A second being one second long

Examples of things that are chaotic
> Randomness, to an extent
> A river flowing uphill
> Breaking the laws of physics
> Time travel
> What Lovecraft thought that Noneuclidian meant, even though he was really wrong about that

Alignment kind of falls apart when you think that both the Rule of Law, which says that no one is above the law, a position of equality, and Nobility, which puts someone above the law, or at least represented more so than others in an unequal fashion, are both lawful positions, which is silly, just throw out alignment. This setting does not require you to pay attention to alignment. 

=== Astronomy ===
This section is the explanation of how the astronomical set up of the setting is.

The solar system in which Penzavie exists is as follows:
> Plumos, the star, a wonderful beacon of light. 
> A rocky and hot planet, dark colors across the surface, blasted by solar winds. Inspitable. The closest to Plumos.
> Penzavie, the second planet, the one where magic happens. It has two moons.
	> Cele: A larger moon, tidally locked, orbits every 26 days
	> Wast: A smaller moon, further out, orbitting once each 53 days. Going there and returning to Penzavie takes from the prime material plane to the Mundane Universe (the universe without magic)
> There are many asteroids between the inner two planets and the outer planets, similar to the solar system containing Earth.
> The Protector is a gas giant that functions similar to Jupiter and protects the inner planets. There is a diety that is associated with this planet. Going to this planet and then back to Penzavie will put someone in the Prime Material, even if they came from the Mundane Universe. Protector has many many moon and rings.
> A small rocky planet that is cobalt and brown.
> A second gas giant that is blue with no rings.
> A third gas giant that is red and has rings. It has a dark band across it's equator. Because of it's tilt, at certain times in history, it looks like an eye, with the rings as the whites, the red as the iris, and the black as the pupel. This affects mythos and there are outsiders that associate with this planet.
> There is a small rocky and ice planet far out. This has three moons. It's cute.
> ALSO THERE ARE MANY BEAUTIFUL COMETS
