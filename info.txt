This txt should have all information you need to understand Penzavie. Remember that this fantasy setting, although DnD compatable, is not purely for Dungeons and Dragons, and is meant to be compatable with other games, such as Dungeon World, Burning Wheel, 13th Age, and others.

=== Cosmology ===
This section is the explanation of what the various planes of existance of the setting are.

> Penzavie, the prime material, the mixture of magic and mundane. 
	This plane is as shown by the map, seen above, and is described in great detail in the section labeled History
> The Mundane Universe, a plain world, not too disimilar to our Earth. No magic at all. 
> The Magic Realm, a world where magic rules. Hard to many people understand the layout of this realm. 
> Iustium, the Upper Ring, the Ring of Law, 
	> Planar North of the prime material
	> Angels, Devils, Modrons, and Inevitables are from this place.
> Conturb, the Lower Ring, the Ring of Chaos, 
	> Planar South of the prime material
	> Archons, Demons, Slaad are from this place.
> The Ring of Elements
	> Circles arounnd the prime material
	> Elementals are from this place.
> The Elsewhere, the space between planes, where Abberations roam.

== About Alignment == 
While the standard DnD alignments are alluded to in this lore, do not think that they are an objective truth. They are a narrative constructed by planar outsiders. While individuals might be able to categorized into an alignment, no race, ancestry, or group can be categorized into an alignment. The standards of what is Good and Evil are subjective. While this fiction instills that bigotry, slavery, and genocide are evil, it is unhelpful to try to use DnD alignment to quantify or categorize groups the way that standard DnD does. 

That being said, Iustium and Conturb as locations have personality and will make assertions on what is lawful and chaotic. Below are examples of how they do so.

Examples of things that are lawful
> Consistancy
> Order
> A river flowing in a jungle
> A second being one second long

Examples of things that are chaotic
> Randomness, to an extent
> A river flowing uphill
> Breaking the laws of physics
> Time travel
> What Lovecraft thought that Noneuclidian meant, even though he was really wrong about that

Alignment kind of falls apart when you think that both the Rule of Law, which says that no one is above the law, a position of equality, and Nobility, which puts someone above the law, or at least represented more so than others in an unequal fashion, are both lawful positions, which is silly, just throw out alignment. This setting does not require you to pay attention to alignment. 

Really alignment is just something that Angels made up to convince people that genocide was okay.

=== Astronomy ===
This section is the explanation of how the astronomical set up of the setting is.

The solar system in which Penzavie exists is as follows:
> Plumos, the star, a wonderful beacon of light. 
> A rocky and hot planet, dark colors across the surface, blasted by solar winds. Inspitable. The closest to Plumos.
> Penzavie, the second planet, the one where magic happens. It has two moons.
	> Cele: A larger moon, tidally locked, orbits every 26 days
	> Wast: A smaller moon, further out, orbitting once each 53 days. Going there and returning to Penzavie takes from the prime material plane to the Mundane Universe (the universe without magic)
> There are many asteroids between the inner two planets and the outer planets, similar to the solar system containing Earth.
> The Protector is a gas giant that functions similar to Jupiter and protects the inner planets. There is a diety that is associated with this planet. Going to this planet and then back to Penzavie will put someone in the Prime Material, even if they came from the Mundane Universe. Protector has many many moon and rings.
> A small rocky planet that is cobalt and brown.
> A second gas giant that is blue with no rings.
> A third gas giant that is red and has rings. It has a dark band across it's equator. Because of it's tilt, at certain times in history, it looks like an eye, with the rings as the whites, the red as the iris, and the black as the pupel. This affects mythos and there are outsiders that associate with this planet.
> There is a small rocky and ice planet far out. This has three moons. It's cute.
> ALSO THERE ARE MANY BEAUTIFUL COMETS

=== Creation ===
Before Omkrei came to the system, Plumos was a young star with a protoplanetary disk. Omkrei saw this young system and waited for it to formed it into the Astronomical configuration that the system would eventually settle on. Upon seeing that the system reached it's potential as a place that could be used to grow world supporting fantastic life, Omkrei began work on their vision. Omkrei needed a world where they could test if the conflicts of other realms with constant between realms. 

> Omkrei establishes the Protector as a deity
> Omkrei makes the Five Watchers
> Five Watcher are instructed to create life while Omkrei makes the outer planes
> Omkrei creates Conturb and Iustium, which have so much energy, that they slowly begin the develop into the sentient. 
> Four of the Five Watchers make sentient nonhunan life, which is not what Omkrei wanted. 
> Omkrei creates the Elemental Ring and throws those four Watchers there for their actions and locks them there. The Deviant watchers are named: 
	> Dracus
	> Abdom
	> Rak
	> Mandula
> Omkrei creates the Aiens, dieties for the humanoid sentient life of Penzavie, then gives them a model for what humanoid life looks like (made of stone, mud, and wood) and asks them to replicate it.
	> Luctu, creator of Elves, which includes standard elves, drow, dolr
		> Dolr are blue skinned humanoids with antennae which help them with balance
		> I might make Dolr be Zuthem, or make them more "orcish" to be a counterpoint to elves?
	> Fermul, creator of Dwarves, which includes standard dwarves and gnomes
	> Conum, creator of Zuthem, which includes humans and orcs
	> Berth, creator of Pethem, which includes halflings, goblins, and kobolds
> Omkrei breathes deific life into Plumos, charges them with keeping the planes in order, and ends the Age of Creation. Measurable time begins afterwards. 

== Notes on the creations of the Aiens ==
Humanoid sentient life, along with the creations of the Diviant Watchers, were spread fairly evenly across the globe when they first were created.6

> Elves are tall and live long (about 5 centuries)
> Dwarves are short and live long
> Zuthem are tall and live short (about 1 century)
> Pethem are short and live short

= A note about terminology =
This text uses Ancestry when refering to what are commonly known in DnD as "races" due to the implications that the word race carries with it.

Each of the four ancestries has at least one variant which is reptilian, one variant that is a furry mammalian, and two variants that are minimally furred mammalians (like humans). 

Ancestries can produce fertile offspring between them, but over time, any community with multiple ancestries that brings in no other genetic material will tend to magically shift towards whatever ancestry, out of the ancestries present in that community, has the smallest global population at that time. 

=== History ===
Year 0, the Epoch, is marked by the awakening of Plumos as a diety. This awakening allowed "civilization" (loaded term) to arise where it could not before in the everchanging realm before measurable time. This text will use civilization to mean any group of people who self-organize themselves and identify under a certain banner. They may share culture, government, or some other feature.

In the first few centuries of measurable time, the precursors to what would become as the "first civilizations" arose and established themselves across the world. Their history is unclear, due to lack of records from that time. They are as follows:

> Various tribes in Northern Tooth, including the Kan and Twll lineages, warring among each other
> Various tribes in Southern Tooth, including those who would become the Tulnid culture, beginning their communication with each other
> Communes in the North of Shard who would become the Nul culture when they join with their neighbors
> The various groups who would become the TwaldHas culture, making the first walled towns in Central Shard
> The Jungle Rivers of South Shard attracted hunters
> The first domestication of animals happened in plains to the West of the mountains of East Venn with those who made massive fences then after many years of strinking those fences, successfully could farm deer. 
> Desert wanderers in the Far-East Venn Desert settle near the rivers of this area.
> Individuals in the Tooth Islands and Tail try to learn sailing, because fish taste nice.
> The hearty people in the west river valley in South Chain who would become the culture of Ochisio.

=== Deities ===
This is a list of the true forms of dieties that exist in Penzavie. Dieties in this text are sometimes referenced to as Aspects of a diety, this is who they truly are, not interpreted by a culture.

> Omkrei, grand creator
> Nature, an unnamed god of the Nature and the Natural Realms
> Dracus, primordial
> Abdom, primordial
> Rak, primordial
> Mandula, primordial
> Luctu, elves
> Fermul, dwarves
> Conum, humans
> Berth, pethem
