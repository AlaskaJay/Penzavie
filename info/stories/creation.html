			<p>
				The history of <a href="../locations/penzavie.html">Penzavie<a> begins with the discovery of the star <a href="../locations/plumos.html">Plumos<a> by the creator god <a href="../deities/omkrei">Omkrei</a>. They found a young star surrounded in it's disk of dust, early in it's development. Plumos could have been a completely mundane star with completely mundane planets and bodies orbiting it. Some of those planets might have even had life appear on them without any intervention. Omkrei, however, had other plans. They took the dust and their divine power to create a collection of planets, moon, spare clusters of rock and dust, and other bodies. One of these planets would become Penzavie.<br>
				The world began as a lifeless rock, but was soon given life by Omkrei. They brought forth the water of the seas and oceans, the mountain and valleys, and the basic plants and animals. All were carefully crafted as Omkrei had remembered them to be from previous worlds, but Omkrei did not want to make a perfect recreation of what they had observed. They created their world using an imperfect memory and a bias towards their morality.
